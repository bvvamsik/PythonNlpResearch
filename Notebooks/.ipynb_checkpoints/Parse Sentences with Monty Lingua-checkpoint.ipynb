        "1783 along with temp . the wind and currents are a component when it comes to coral bleaching .\n",
        "1806 the reason why the corals get bleached is because there is a change in the water and in the temperature , wind and current that why the coral loses it color . this is really bad for the environment , that why we should keep our waters clean and not throw trash in the ocean because it not only affects the corals it affects us too .\n",
        "1813 coral bleach will happen if someone goes blast fishing , or tourist who drop anchors or walk on reefs can cause the coral to eject the zooxanthellae to come out . coral can go through photosynthesis and release oxygen .\n",

        "1852 what causes coral bleaching to vary is cause of shifting trade winds . once in a while trade wind\n",
        "1871 coral needs co2 in the water and needs to be warm source emta yaris ( 0000 ) . coral needs sunlight and coral bleaching occurs when in it too cold and co2 levels are low .\n",

        "1911 coral needs worm ar it will start bleaching . if coral does have zooxanth it cannot life it will also start bleaching itself and die , in conclusion coral bleaching rates vary at times because of wind changes and zooxanthallae\n",
        "1915 with those chemicals the corals will have the right amount of energy and can survive . corals receive 00 % to 00 % of their energy during the process .\n",
        "1926 this is because it will also help from the coral breaking or whatever the cause may be . also stated in the third article .\n",
        "1934 thats when the coral starts to become white from the bleaching . the coral can + will starve and contain a disease if the coral develops stress . when the coral goes to long without zooxanthelle , bleaching can lead to death .\n",
        "1938 in conclusion , many things can help leading to cause coral bleaching as like the water temperature . fishermen may cause dirty substances . algae + zooxanthelle might die which makes the coral die .\n",
        "1941 first off , coral goes through photosynthesis to get their energy ( 00 % to 00 % of it ) for this to happen coral needs water temp . between 00 - 00 f .\n",
        "1942 but when trade winds alter directions they shift surface water eastward causing water temp . to increase 0 f to 0 f .\n",
        "1943 so without a constant temp . photosynthesis in the coral can not take place .\n",
        "1948 in conclusion , coral bleaching varies at different times because of : shifting trade winds that cause temp . change , and stressful environments that cause them to eject algae and make them vulnerable .\n",
        "1950 one effect on coral bleaching is the temperature . if reef - building coral is in shallow water the temperature needs to be a certain level in this case 00 - 00 f if temperature is higher or lower then photosynthesis will not curr because it is very sensitive stage\n",
        "1976 they are sensitive to ocean salinity . when excessive rainfall happens ( goes into water ) , the salinity drops .\n",
        "2018 all of this mix up of the winds causes the water to collide . this is the cause of coral bleaching .\n",
        "2042 in 0000 there were around 00 bleaching reports , that same time trade winds were + 0 . 0 seconds than what they normally are .\n",

        "2062 corals are very sensitive to how salty the water is , they need salty water to survive . coral gets its food from zooxanthellea , and algae provides them their color .\n",
        "2081 environment conditions can also be part of coral bleaching . the shifting of trade winds leading to upwelling , changes the pacific surface waters to be colder than those in the western pacific all of these factors occur on different times at different places . concluding on why coral bleaching rates vary at different times .\n",
        "2089 in 0000 . about 00 % of the world coral reefs have died .\n",
        "2092 coral bleaching can have many variables that effect it . weather , temperature , sunlight and may not be receiving proper amount of oxygen .\n",
        "2134 during storms , when the fresh water hits the ocean , the salinity drops which threatens the balance to keep the corals healthy . changes in wind , ocean currents , and temperatures could affect the coral bleaching like in 0000 when this happened in the pacific ocean .\n",
        "2139 when the solubility of co2 decreased the corals dont have enough co2 to keep color and maintain healthy the higher water temperatures and weak tradelink effect coral bleaching because at times the water temp may be to high , corals must live in specific temps . '\n",
        "2144 this is caused by weakened winds or wind blowing reverse direction from west to east . another reason coral bleaching rates vary at different times is because of water temperature .\n",
        "2199 it blows warm water , east or west . the temperature of water changes environment . other than the temperature change other things can cause coral bleaching .\n",
        "2203 if zooxanthellae are not present coral can also die . they are what makes the corals food source .\n",
        "2207 when water temperatures increase coral can not do the process of photo synthesis . photo synthesis only cures in temperatures of 00 - 85f .\n",
        "2215 as the water temperature increases the solubility of co2 in water decreases . coral is very dependent on zooxanthellae .\n",
        "2220 coral bleaching is very dependent on the environmental stressors that can negatively affect the relationship between the coral and zooxanthellae or algae . coral get their energy through algae in the process of photosynthesis and algae also gives coral its color .\n",
        "2222 this is partly because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature . based off of this information , we can conclude that the weather is something to consider when trying to find out how % why rates of coral bleaching vary at different times .\n",
        "2239 coral bleaching means that there was an event where the coral lost its color . when this is happening it increases the corals stress and the coral release their food - producing algae .\n",
        "2264 the coral physical state can make it bleached . blast fishing and dropped anchors can damage its physical state .\n",
        "2265 the enviromental force can damage the nutrients for the coral . in result , the coral will starve and be vulnerable to disease in the state of bleaching and die off .\n",
        "2311 when trade winds change direction the water get warmer . trade winds change because direction because they get weaker .\n",
        "2361 i say that area because of tradewinds . that is when winds travel from east to west and every couple year is switched from west to east .\n",
        "2382 also , the ocean salinity affects this process . because of the photosynthesis changing with the co2 and levels of salinity , the zooxanthallae ( algae ) is affected as well .\n",
        "2383 zooxanthallae cannot live outside of the coral because the tropical ocean is not rich in nutrients , so the coral provides the nutrients needed . the zooxanthallae passes some of the food they make from the suns energy to the coral .\n",
        "2385 coral bleaching is caused by the ejection or death of the zooxanthallae algae . the loss of algae is that coral begins to not be able to respond to the environment by itself .\n",
        "2404 in order for coral reefs to build and live is if the water is 00 - 85f . if the temperature of the water is really low then thats when coral bleaching begins .\n",
        "2422 this affects the coral because as the warm water moves away the marin life follow and the food supply for the coral lessen and my cause death for the coral . the zooxanthallae algae also dies from the cooler water levels when the warm water move away .\n",
        "2448 coral needs warm water to live . pg . 0 . corals are also sensitive to ocean salinity .\n",
        "2451 therefore , the coral loses water . physical damage such as tourist who drop anchors or walks on reefs .\n",
        "2452 corals need algae called zooxanthellae and without they'll bleach and eventually die . this is what happens in coral bleaching .\n",
        "2455 they vary because the temp . changes .\n",
        "2487 it also needs to be in clear shallow water that is o between 00 - 00 of , or else the photosynthesis will be unbalanced . environmental stressors can also cause coral bleaching .\n",
        "2497 another important thing for coral is photosynthesis . it just like any other plant .\n",
        "2500 there are many different things that could affect this process . salinity affects them this is when there is too much salt in the water because of excess rainfall .\n",
        "2502 if the temp of the water increases . the solubility of co2 goes down .\n",
        "2519 many times these winds would change direction , and as a result , the temperatures would change drastically ( for marine life that is ) and could switch from 00 of to 0 of , sometimes even 10of ( shifting trade winds . ) .\n",
        "2525 in the article trade winds and coral bleaching the graph shows how the trade winds affect coral bleaching . when the trade winds weaken the temperature goes up and when the temperature goes up the coral bleaching happen .\n",
        "2531 depending on the high water temps and trade winds it increases the bleaching of coral . salinity helps change corals color because it means how salty the water is .\n",
        "2540 if there is a hurricane or a severe rain event , then the massive amount of fresh water would make the salinity levels go down and that would threaten the health of the coral . also temperature and sunlight affect coral .\n",
        "2556 the trade winds weaken or reverse directions . when that happens the warm surface waters travel eastward .\n",
        "2573 zo was the corals source of energy . if the zo left the coral it was because there was a lot of weaker tradewinds in the ocean or the coral itself ejected the only food supply it had .\n",
        "2576 the pacific ocean goes through a trade wind , when the trade wind drags warm air to the water surface . pacific regions to warm normal water temperatures increase by 3of to 5of says carlton banks in national oceanic and atmospheric\n",
        "2577 once this happens , the water swells . corals live on the ground , and stay in one place .\n",
        "2606 occasionally , however , these winds alter . they can weaken or go in opposite directions .\n",
        "2614 according to the second graph called water temp . versus trade winds in year 0000 there was very low trade wind strength and there was the highest temperature and it is the highest temperature in the graph .\n",
        "2630 this may be a cause of how coral bleach . also when there storms , and when they drop fresh water into the ocean , then the salinity drops .\n",
        "2656 ocean salinity ( how salty the water is ) also threaten the balance necessary to keep the corals healthy ; ocean salinity consists largely of excessive rainfall . corals who sustain physical damage by blast fishing and anchors also affect the defense and health of the coral reef .\n",
        "2674 this can cause an area that is originally 00 - 00 f to warm up by 0 to 0 f or as much as 00 f . also another example is coral need water temperatures to range from 00 - 00 f .\n",
        "2695 photosynthesis is sensitive changes in water temperature . therefore , when the water is decreased so much so quickly , it stops the process of photosynthesis . this disruption threatens the delicate balance required to keep corals healthy .\n",
        "2707 it also say s the drop in salinity threatens the balance to keep coral healthy . these two quotes shows that the change in the environment like temperature dropping or storms can cause reactions in the water that can affect the coral .\n",
        "2710 the zooxanthellae gives the coral its color but if the zooxanthellae is ejected or killed the coral loses its color . so in conclusion that coral bleaching is happening is due to the environment change that affect how the coral structure functions and how it affect their health .\n"
