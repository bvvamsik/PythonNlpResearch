  abstract = {With an increasing focus on science and technology in education comes an awareness that students must be able to understand and integrate scientific explanations from multiple sources.  As part of a larger project aimed at deepening our understanding of student processes for integrating multiple sources of information, we are developing machine learning and natural language processing techniques for evaluating students' argumentative essays.  In previous work, we have focused on identifying conceptual elements of the essays.  In this paper, we present a method for inferring the causal structure of student essays. We used a standard parser to derive grammatical dependencies of the essay and converted them to logic statements.  Then a simple inference mechanism was used to identify concepts linked to syntactic connectors by these dependencies. The results suggest that we will soon be able to provide explicit feedback that enables teachers and students to improve comprehension.}

The model aims to explain observed trends in both the mean and dispersion of response time (RT) with respect to both menu length and amount of practice. Our model follows previous work in assuming that the primary strategies for determining the location of the target menu item are visual search and recall from memory. The model introduces a hypothesis about how the visual search is performed that yields a very good fit with no free parameters for the slope of the linear relationship between RT and menu length. We validated this hypothesis by testing the modelâ€™s predictions for the dispersion of RT. The model was also used to generate predictions to test the hypothesis that the observed RT reduction with practice could be predicted based on RT being the sum of the time required for initiating the task and the lesser of the realized visual search time or realized recall time. The model generated predictions for both means and dispersion of RT as a function of practice.}

This study investigated the efficacy of three different algorithms at classifying student essays according to an expert model of the essay topic which categorized statements by argument function, including claims and integration. A novel classification algorithm is presented which uses multi-word regular expressions.  Its performance is compared to that of Latent Semantic Analysis and several variants of the Support Vector Machine algorithm at the same classification task. One variant of the SVM approach worked better overall, but another proved more successful at detecting integration within and across texts. This research has important implications for systems that can gauge the level of integration demonstrated through the written word.}

Specifically these approaches were developed to classify whether or not important elements of the texts were present in the essays. The first was a simple pattern-matching approach called multi-word that allowed flexible matching of words and phrases in the sentences. The second technique was Latent Semantic Analysis, which was used to compare student sentences to original source sentences using its high-dimensional vector-based representation. Finally the third was a machine learning technique, Support Vector Machines, which learned a classification scheme from the corpus. The results of the study suggested that the LSA-based system was superior for detecting the presence of explicit content from the texts, but the multi-word pattern matching approach was better for detecting inferences outside or across texts. These results suggest that the best approach for analyzing essays of this nature should draw upon multiple natural language processing approaches.}

Previous research with the Reading Tutor has focused primarily on native speaking populations.  In this study 34 Hispanic students spent one month in the classroom and one month using the Reading Tutor for 25 minutes per day.  The Reading Tutor condition produced significant learning gains in several measures of fluency.  Effect sizes ranged from 0.55 to 1.27.

This chapter briefly describes how LSA has been effectively integrated in some of the applications developed at the Institute for Intelligent Systems, the University of Memphis.  The chapter subsequently identifies some weaknesses of the current use of LSA and proposes a few methods to overcome these weaknesses.  One problem addresses statistical properties of an LSA space when it is used as a measure of similarity, while the second problem addresses the limited use of dimensional information in the vector representation.  With respect to the statistical aspect of LSA, we propose using the standardized value of cosine matches for similarity measurements between documents.  Such standardization is based on both the statistical properties of the LSA space and the properties of the specific application.  With respect to the dimensional information in LSA vectors, we propose three different methods of using LSA vectors in computing similarity between documents.  The three methods adapt to (1) learner perspective, (2) context, and (3)conversational history.  These adaptive methods are assessed by examining the relationship between LSA similarity measure and keyword-match based similarity measures.  We argue that LSA can be more powerful if such extensions are appropriately used in applications.}

SAIF uses Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a string-matching technique and a pattern-matching algorithm to identify problems in students' essays. These problems include plagiarism, uncited quotation, lack of citations, and limited content integration. SAIF provides feedback and constructs examples to demonstrate explicit citations to help students improve their essays. In addition to describing SAIF, we also present the results of two experiments. In the first experiment, SAIF was found to detect source identification and integration problems in student essays at a comparable level to human raters. The second experiment tested the effectiveness of SAIF in helping students write better essays. Students given SAIF feedback included more explicit citations in their essays than students given sourcing-reminder instructions or a simple prompt to revise.}
