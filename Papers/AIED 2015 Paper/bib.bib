RMT includes five topics that correspond to the curriculum of introductory research methods courses: ethics, variables, reliability, validity, and experimental design.  We evaluated the effectiveness of the RMT system in the classroom using a non-equivalent control group design.  Students in three classes (n = 73) used RMT, and students in two classes (n = 52) did not use RMT.  Results indicated that the use of RMT yielded strong learning gains of .71 SD above classroom instruction alone.  Further, the dialogue-based tutoring condition of the system resulted in higher gains than the textbook-style condition (CAI version) of the system.  Future directions for RMT include the addition of new topics and tutoring elements.}

tutoring system designed for use in conjunction with 
courses in psychology research methods.  The current RMT 
system includes five topic sections: ethics, variables, 
reliability, validity, and experimental design.  The tutor can 
be used in an "agent mode," which utilizes synthesized 
speech and an interactive pedagogical agent, or in a "text-only mode,"
which presents the tutor content in written text 
on the screen.  The tutor was used in three psychology 
research methods courses during the winter and spring 
quarters of 2006 at DePaul University.  These three sections 
were evaluated against two (non-equivalent) control 
sections that did not use the RMT system.  Pretest and 
posttest scores on a research methods knowledge test were 
used to assess learning in each class.  Results indicated that, 
compared with the two control sections, the classes that 
used RMT showed significantly higher learning gains.  In 
addition, those that used the agent version of the tutor 
showed significantly higher learning gains than those who 
used the text-only version of the tutor.  Future directions 
will focus on expanding the current RMT content to include 
conceptual statistics and more complex research designs and 
to identify subgroups of students for which RMT may be 
particularly useful.}

  abstract = {This paper describes the design of a game which is aimed at teaching argumentation skills to college students.  Ability to understand and generate arguments is critical for STEM and a broad range of other fields, but it is sorely lacking in students today.  Building on our prior experience creating intelligent tutoring systems for teaching argumentation skills, we have designed a game so that we can compare the effectiveness of the two approaches.  This paper describes the design of the game from the viewpoint of cognitive principles and frameworks for serious game design.}}

Yet reading is most often taught with single sources.  In this paper, we explore techniques for analyzing student essays to give feedback to teachers on how well their students deal with multiple texts.  We compare the performance of a simple regular expression matcher to Latent Semantic Analysis and to Support Vector Machines, a machine learning approach.}

  abstract = {  Research Methods Tutor (RMT) is a dialog-based intelligent tutoring
  system which has been used by students in Research Methods in
  Psychology classes since 2003.  Students interact with RMT to
  reinforce what they learn in class in five different topics.  In
  this paper, we evaluate a different population of students and
  replicate our prior research: despite the
  relatively small amount of exposure during the term to RMT compared
  to other course-related activities, students learn significantly
  more on topics covered with RMT (Arnott, 2008).  However, we did not
  find the same advantage for the dialog-based tutoring mode of RMT
  over the CAI mode.  When transcript analyses indicated that a small
  but significant number of students were gaming the system by
  entering empty or nonsense responses, we modified the tutor to
  require reasonable attempts.  This did lead some students to reform
  their gaming ways.  In other cases, however, it resulted in
  disengagement from tutoring at least temporarily because reasonable
  answers were not recognized.}

They enter school with less prior knowledge of English sounds, word meanings, and sentence structure, and they get little or no reinforcement of their learning outside of the classroom.  This paper compares the classroom standard practice of sustained silent reading with the Project LISTEN Reading Tutor which uses automated speech recognition to "listen" to children read aloud, providing both spoken and graphical feedback.  Previous research with the Reading Tutor has focused primarily on native speaking populations.  In this study 34 Hispanic students spent one month in the classroom and one month using the Reading Tutor for 25 minutes per day.  The Reading Tutor condition produced significant learning gains in several measures of fluency.  Effect sizes ranged from 0.55 to 1.27.  These dramatic results from  a one-month treatment indicate this technology may have much to offer English language learners.}
