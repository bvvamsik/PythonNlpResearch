Corals are living animals in the ocean.
Corals live in one place and dont really move alot.
Some corals have white on them and that is called "coral bleaching."
Coral Bleaching means that the coral is unhealthy and is trusting into a white color.
Normal water tempatures that the coral live in are 70-80 degrees.
But some of the waters are too cool like 3 to 10 degrees F.
Corals are also affected by storms because corals rely on the amounts of salt in the waters.
So when it storms the water tempatures and levels of salt will be all mest up and bad for the coral.
The storms have to be very extreme to make corals sick or unhealthy.
In the water if the tempature increases the amounts of dioxide will drop and willmake the coral unhealthy.
The water tempatures coral usally build their reefs in are 70-85 degrees F.
So those are the tempature range to keep them healthy.
Corals and zooanthellae algae have a relatioship together.
Most zooanthellae can not live without outside the corals bodies.
It is because there isnt enough nutrience to have the ocean do photosynthesis.
The zooanthellae rely on the coral to stay healthy, but the coral can get physical damage.
Coral bleaching is a physical damage to the corals.
Coral bleaching is also an example how the envionmental stressors can affect the relationships between the coral and the algae.
